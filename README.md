# Bootstrap Test
### A simple tempate with every Bootstrap element present for quick and easy theme building

## Why?

I created this as a tool for myself to quickly be able to test color themes and edits to the standard Bootstrap theme wihtout having to deal with version control within my own apps. Every element is present in a condensed manner so you can see how all items look next to each other. This is not intended to be a starter template, just a template for theme building. 

## To use:

You'll need a Sass compiler of some kind (I recommend using [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) if you have a Mac), but that's it. The initial compile has been run already and is linked as `css/style.css` in the header. A link to a jQuery CDN and the Bootstap javascript file are also already in there. Simply set up your Sass compiler of choice, navigate to the index.html file, and you're ready to go!
